"""CDS Invenio Multiple Record Editor Engine.

Every action related to record modification is performed
by specific class (successor of some of the commands).
Every of these classes is designed to perform specific action.

The engine itself receives a list of this classes and after retrieving
the records, asks the commands to perform their changes. This way the
engine itself is independent of the actions for modification of the records.

When we need to perform a new action on the records, we define a new command
and take care to pass it to the engine.


***************************************************************************
Subfield commands represent the actions performed on the subfields
of the record. The interface of these commands is defined in their
base class.
