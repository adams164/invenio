This directory is dedicated to the conversion of records, notably to
be able to import SPIRES records to Invenio.  See also
<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Inspire/RecordComparison>.

The conversion from SPIRES to Invenio is governed by the stylesheet
SPIRES2MARC.xsl.  You may want to edit it and run 'make test' to see
it in action.
