INSPIRE git repository
----------------------

INSPIRE sources are to be installed after the CDS Invenio sources.

You can customize some things in config-local.mk, for example on
Debian GNU/Linux, use:

   $ cat config-local.mk
   INSTALL = install -g www-data -m 775

To install a small INSPIRE demo site from scratch, you can use the
attached conf/inspire-recreate-demo-site script for inspiration.
